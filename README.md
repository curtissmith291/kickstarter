# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing an analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
Data were pulled from Kickstater to introduce students to using Excel, basic Excel functions, and basic stastical analyses. 
Specific data pertaining to Louise's desire to start a kickstarter for a musical in Great Britain. Pivot tables and box plots were used to aid in the analysis. 
Louise has a target of aproximately $4,000 to fund the musical, and analysis of successful to failed musicals suggest that the funding goal is a reasonable target. The box plot showed that the mean musical goal was approximately $4,000 and was within the IQR. The box plot is presented below:
